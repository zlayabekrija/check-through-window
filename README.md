#### The humorous weather app

Weather app project, built on top of Openweather api, with additonal help of flags.io for providing the country flags.

For assetes menagment the webpack was used, and for making api calls built in javascript Fetch Api is used.

Known bugs:
 - Firefox can't read navigator and thus no api calls can be made, using browser native navigator.

Steps to run this app:

- Clone the app

- run `npm run build` to build and compile the assets.

- run `npm run server` to run app on local machine.

- enjoy.

Still looking for some api with houmorous comments, feel free to suggest.

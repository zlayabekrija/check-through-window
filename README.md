For assetes menagment the webpack was used, and for making api calls built in javascript Fetch Api is used.



Steps to run this app:

- Clone the app

- run `npm run build` to build and compile the assets.

- run `npm run server` to run app on local machine.

- enjoy.

Still looking for some api with houmorous comments, feel free to suggest.
